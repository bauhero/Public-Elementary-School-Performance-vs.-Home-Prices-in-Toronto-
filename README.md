In Ontario elementary schools, you must be residing within a school catchment (boundaries) in order to attend the school in that area. 
So our main concern it to find whether there isany correlation between school performances and home prices?
Hypothesis: 
Is there any correlation between school performance and housing prices. The better the school performance the higher the housing prices.

Research Questions:
Is there any difference in housing prices between different FSAs?
Is there any difference between the average rating of Toronto School Board vs Toronto Catholic school boards
Do the differences in home prices contribute to the educational disparities that occur between low and middle to high-income students?
